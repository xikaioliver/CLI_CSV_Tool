# CLI_CSV_Tool
The command line tool generates one log file every day. All logs will be saved in this folder. All logs are named by the date.
Please do not delete this folder, otherwise you will cause corruption in logging system. In that case, you can fix it by creating a new "Log" folder. Delete log files inside this folder is fine, it will not cause corruption.
The tool does not delete any log files automatically. You can clean them manually if you wish.
